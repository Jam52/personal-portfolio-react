              <p>
                Ive always been a builder, one of those kids obsessed with
                legos, making sand castles and scultpures out of mud and sticks
                (I still do) and the drive to build and create has never left
                me.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first career was in industrial design, that part of my story
                is long and contains all kinds of things including a BA in
                furniture and industrial design, emigrating to Canada and
                starting a furniture business with my father. It wasnâ€™t until I
                was around 30 that my coding journey started.

              <h3 className={classes.section_subtitle}>My road to Code</h3>
              <p>
                A friend of mine introduced me to the world of code via a few
                basic tutorials, when he was going through a bootcamp, he knew
                me well and thought that I might enjoy it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Turns out he was right, I became hooked. For a few years I hobby
                coded doing a intro courses in several areas and languages
                including JavaScript, Java and Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                After it was clear coding was something I wanted to do more
                seriously I decided to take the plunge. I left my industrial
                design career to study web development and pursue a new career
                while looking after my young daughter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working with mentors, local meetup groups and friends I studied
                hard, gaining several certifications and building my knowledge
                bit by bit. My first break into tech has been with Adastra Corp
                in the Business Intelegence team. Adastra is an interesting and
                supportive company predominantly working in data and cloud. I
                have learned so much already and am excited to continue my new
                career.
